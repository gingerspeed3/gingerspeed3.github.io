          <h2>About Team 2/5 RSM</h2>
          <p>
            The relationship between the City of Rancho Santa Margarita and the 2nd Battalion, 5th Marines (the 2/5) began in January 2007 when the City “adopted” the 2/5 to assist these Marines and their families.
         </p>
         <p>
            Based at Camp Pendleton, 2/5 is the most decorated infantry battalion in the Marines. Since this battalion was activated in 1917, its members have proudly served our nation all over the world in virtually every major military campaign, including World War I, World War II, the Korean War, Vietnam, Desert Shield and Desert Storm.  To learn more about the history and many accomplishments of the brave Marines of 2/5 please visit their website.
         </p>
         <p>
            The mission of Rancho Santa Margarita 2nd Battalion, 5th Marines Support Group, Inc. as a 501 (c) (3) non-profit organization is to provide community and financial support to the men and families of the 2/5 both during deployments and when training for the next deployment.
         </p>
         <p>
            Donations to Rancho Santa Margarita 2nd Battalion, 5th Marines Support Group, Inc. are used primarily to assist family members of the 2/5, especially the families of younger enlisted men, with unexpected expenses while their Marines are away on deployment.
         </p>
         <p>
            For the residents of this community to express their gratitude and appreciation to those who go forward to defend our Country's ideals and interests, in such a personal way, goes way beyond making some sort of political statement, and the Marines know it.
         </p>
         <p>
            These Marines will face many challenges and difficulties as they fight for our freedom. Their individual futures remain uncertain, but one thing they know is that they can count on our continued support. Your thoughts and prayers for their safety and your generous support for their families at home will allow them to fully focus on their assigned combat missions.
         </p>
         <p>
            Thank you for your continued support.
